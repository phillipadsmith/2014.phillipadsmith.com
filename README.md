# Some crazy idea about publishing online

What can I tell you: this the source code repository for my [personal & work blog](http://phillipadsmith.com/) -- there's really not much of a firewall between the two, because [I love what I do](http://phillipadsmith.com/about/). 

I've been blogging (irregularly) since about 2001. I started with [Greymatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)) (one of my earliest introductions to Perl), lost that blog while learning (the hard way) about software RAID configuration on my first FreeBSD server, restarted with [Movable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type), experimented with Melody, and eventually ended up here with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

[Static site generators are a bit of an obsession at the moment](http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/staticnewsapps/), and this repo is just part of the experiment and learning.

## Technical TODO list

* [x] ~~Set-up [jekyll-hook](https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook)~~
* [x] Re-enable mod_pagespeed for this site
* [ ] Responsive image generation: automatically generate the various sizes if not provided in the front matter
* [ ] Upgrade Jekyll to take advantage of faster regeneration, etc.
* [ ] Start migrating posts from the old Community Bandwidth site (circa 2003)
