Just out last month and available via Safari Books Online is [Statistics Done Wrong, The Woefully Complete Guide, by Alex Reinhart](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593276206/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593276206&linkCode=as2&tag=phillipadsmit-20&linkId=GJ6ELFADF73JHGGE)

Another book that recently hit Safari Online Books that I haven't had time to crack yet: [Building Microservices, designing fine-grained systems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1491950358&linkCode=as2&tag=phillipadsmit-20&linkId=PXZNYA24Z67MXLVX).

I actually had this book on my list to pick up, and then a friend handed me a copy to borrow a few weeks ago: [Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator-ebook/dp/B0074VTHH0/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=phillipadsmit-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=CNXDJG3G7RZ372ES&creativeASIN=B0074VTHH0), by Ryan Holiday.
