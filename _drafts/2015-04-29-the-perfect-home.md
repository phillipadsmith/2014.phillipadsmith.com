[As I've been known to do in the past](/tags/forty/), I've spent a bit of time this week pondering what the next few years might look like. If you've been following along, [you already know that I'm a bit of a "rambler"](/covering/) and that I like to keep moving -- so "the future" is always a bit of a moving target.

This has made it challenging to define what the term "home" means. Is it where I store my hammocks? A tricky metric, as they tend to move around the world with me. Where I have close friends and a family? I am lucky to have a tribe almost wherever I go. Where I hold a lease? At times in my life, I've had up to three of them on the go at once. Home is not an easy concept to define for me.

One thing has become clear, however: as I seek to embrace minimalism and simplicity in my life, what I envision as "the perfect home" increasingly becomes more symbolic, less sentimental, and ultimately practical.

This week I am blessed with the opportunity to spend a few days living with my best friend in the luxurious confines of an [Airstream]() and a [yurt](). However, what at first was a good-humoured adventure in urban ["glamping"]() has actually ignited a fire in my mind...

![Airstream livin'](https://a0.muscache.com/ic/pictures/75746759/4fa554f2_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large&output-format=progressive-jpeg&output-quality=70)
What at first appeared like a novelty has actually started growing on me. Something about the well-considered simplicity of the Airstream makes so much sense; it is so small, but it contains everything you could possibly imagine. Every space is used perfectly and thoughtfully. Kitchen with gas stove. Bathroom with composting toilet. LED lighting (on dimmers!) throughout. It's a testiment to simple living.

In this small backyeard where we are staying, there's room for an Airstream, a yurt (the "guest bedroom") and ample space for lounging outside. It is a paradise, really.

As I ponder the next few years, I have to admit, my idea of "The Perfect Home" has started to take bit more shape.

Stay tuned...
