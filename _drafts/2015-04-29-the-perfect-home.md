[As I've been known to do in the past](TK), I've spent a bit of time this week pondering what the next few years might look like. If you've been following along, [you already know that I'm a bit of a "rambler"](TK) and that I like to keep moving.

This has made it challenging to define what the term "home" means. Is it where I store my hammocks? A tricky metric, as they tend to move around the world with me. Where I have friends and family? They are also spread out across the continent. Where I have a lease? At times in my life, I've had three on the go at once. Home is not an easy concept to define for me.

One thing has become clear, however: as I seek to embrace minimalism and simplicity in my life, what I envision as "the perfect home" increasingly become more symbolic.

This week I am blessed with the opportunity to spend a few days living with my best friend in the luxurious confines of an [Airstream](TK) and a [yurt](TK). However, what at first was a good-humoured adventure in urban ["glamping"](TK) has actually ignited a fire in my mind...

What at first appeared like a novelty has actually started growing on me. Something about the well-considered simplicity of the Airstream makes so much sense; it is so small, but it contains everything you could possibly imagine. Every space is used perfectly and thoughtfully. Kitchen with gas stove. Bathroom with composting toilet. LED lighting (on dimmers!) throughout. It's a testiment to simple living.

In this small backyeard where we are staying, there's room for an Airstream, a yurt (the "guest bedroom") and ample space for lounging outside. It is a paradise, really.

As I ponder the next few years, I have to admit, my idea of "The Perfect Home" has started to take bit more shape.

Stay tuned...
