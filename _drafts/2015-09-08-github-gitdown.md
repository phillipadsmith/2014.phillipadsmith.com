TODO

[ ] - Set-up the Awesome Github repo/list

[ ] - Do an initial population of the list

**Today, Github is virtually everywhere**. It’s become a part of most developers’ daily lives, and is increasingly spreading to the lives of non-developers too. From [civic hackers](TK), researchers and policymakers to educators, [journalists](TK) and project managers, it seems like the whole world is “going Github.” 
{: .lead }

**The problem is: Github is still surprisingly hard for most everyday users to use and unlock full potential**. Non-technical users hit big barriers when trying to understand what Github is all about. And even experienced users struggle to keep up with all the new features, third-party integrations, and open-source innovations. 

Given that premise, I decided to propose a session for the [Mozilla Festival](TK), with the hope that some of the bright minds that gather there will be interested in hacking on solutions to this problem. This post is an edited version of the actual proposal that was submitted.

So, with some solid intentions and a no small amount of luck, we'll set out to map out a bit of Github’s territory, to ask the question “What if…?,” and to wax poetic about what might be possible in this new world of open, networked, co-creation. 

I was thinking that the session would kick off with a mapping exercise aimed at collectively capturing everything we know about the current terrain: from organic Github knowledge memes like the “[Awesome Lists](TK)”, to touching on the best learning resources for beginners and experts, while also capturing the hidden gems and tricks for making Github do more.

From there, we’d break into some groups based on interest and try to tackle  some very specific questions like: “How could Github be easier for beginners?,” “What are all the ways to write a book on Github?,”  “What else could we grow in Github’s fertile ground?”  

One important outcome would be an evolving “map” that lived on Github. It would be similar to the “curated list of awesome lists” (https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and would focus on the theme of Github itself, e.g.:

* Where are the best tutorials and entry points for beginners? 
* And what are the biggest *gaps* or current needs within that list? What still needs to be written, built, or developed? 

My home is that by flying our "pirate flag" on Github we will be able to attract contributors who are similarly obsessed with the coming Github World Order.

An aspirational outcome would be to take the highly-ranked ideas from the “What more can we grow in Github’s fertile ground?” question into hands-on makers sessions at Mozfest, agitating for participants to start prototyping new tools, services, and so on. A Github-powered tool as world changing as Bostock’s bl.ocks.org could be the next thing to come out of Mozfest.
