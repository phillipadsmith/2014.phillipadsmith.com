title: "Book review: Busy"
---

In a modern-day laptop there is enough power to edit a movie, to mix a song, to build the foundation of a successful business, or to write, typeset, and publish a novel. It is the creative equivalent of having a nuclear reactor that you carry with you. And yet, if we open that lid without clear intention, it can be like staring into a black whole: a raw, unfiltered, and limitless sea of information so vast that it can easily steal hours from our productive lives.

I had been pondering this tension — the urge to turn to the laptop for creative production, and the danger in turning to it too soon — when I started reading the book [Busy][busy] TK. And, given that it’s been a while since I’ve done a book review, I thought I start with [this one][busy].

On my journey through the book, I realized that much of what I felt in my gut about technology these last several years was born out by research. For example:

Example one.

Example two.

Example three.

Many might find it odd to hear that I’m reading a book about being busy. As a card-carrying “[Slacktivist][slack]” who has written about [slow e-mail](TK) and who is known to not ready e-mail on the weekends, many might assume that “busy” is not challenge that I struggle with. If only it were that simple…

Busy is the pull of that “urgent” but not necessarily important quadrant of life distracts from seeing the bigger picture. It is the constant interruptions that prevent us from finding “flow” in our work. It is a life so fully scheduled that there is no time for reflection. And, frankly, it is something that I witness everyone in my life struggle with, including myself.

As someone who’s put a fair bit of focus on figuring out how to be less busy over the years, I wasn’t expecting to uncover many new ideas in this book — and yet it left me surprised with the amount of insight offered. Here are just a few ideas that were new to me:

* one
* two
* three

Of course, some classics from my own repetoire were also offered up too:

* Do not disturb on iOS and on OS X. Set both regularly! 
* Meditate, exercise, eat first: then start the day.
* If possible, start the day by working on a large task, not e-mail or meetings. My current schedule makes this pretty challenging, unfortunately, so I try to TK…

In sum, if you struggle with the plague of our time called “business,” it would be hard to find a better remedy for such a low investment of time or money than [Busy][busy]. Kudos to Author Name TK for taking a well-covered topic and putting some new, researched-supported light on it. The chapter summaries are particularly considerate, given the target audience.

[Go get less busy and reclaim some of your life][busy].
