title: Help us bake tasty GitHub cupcakes at Mozfest
---

**We at [Mozfest][mozfest] this weekend and we have a plan.** We aim to turn this [Getting down with GitHub session][session] in an "idea kitchen," and -- over the course of the weekend -- we hope to engage Mozillians far and wide in an effort to bake some tasty new cupcakes, i.e., new ideas, products, and services built on top of the world’s largest co-creation platform. The essential ingredient, however, is *you*. Whether your work focuses on participation or education, whether you are a "[hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_writer)" or a hacker, and no matter what your expertise or passion -- as long as you're obsessed with GitHub -- [this session][session] is for you.

After the session, we'll move the recipies out of the kitchen and into the "idea bakery," where we'll make some tasty cupcakes for Mozfest participants to taste. A cupcake hipster-speak for a demonstration or minimum-viable prototype that is still very small, and yet refined enough to be a proxy for something bigger and more polished. We'll work on these prototypes throughout the weekend in the participation space and then get some user feedback at the demo party on Sunday.

Just in the last few weeks while working on the session outline, [Matt](http://twitter.com/openmatt) and I came up with a bunch of ideas that we're excited to explore:

## GitHub Magic "Edit this page" Button

Put simply, now that so many public-facing community websites are hosting on GitHub using GitHub Pages, it should be easy for any project to add an "Edit this page" or "Suggest improvements" button to their site and have it "just work(tm)." More than just opening up the file on GitHub -- a confusing interface for many -- this tool would make the typical "fork, edit, send a pull request" process smooth for all users and would not require the user to sign-up for GitHub account. The [raw material](http://etherpad.io/getting-down-with-github) for making this experience smooth and awesome is at our fingertips, we just need to mix it all together, bake it, and add some beautiful icing. 

## GitHub Magic Carpet Ride

Let's face it, GitHub positions itself as the place "Where software is built," so it should come as no surprise that there are some hurdles for new, non-technical users. Even if a new user can be convinced to create an account, the first screen they see after they've logged is often described as "confusing," "overwhelming," and is full of technical terms that might not make much sense.

This tool, likely a Firefox Add-on, would transform GitHub into a tool that is optimized for a new user, or perhaps a specific category of new users like writers. It would do this by providing a [step-by-step tour](http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-joyride-feature-tour-plugin) of relevant GitHub features and by hiding a lot of the more technical aspects of the site. 

After installing the Add-on, a new user could visit GitHub and they would be walked through the account creation process as well as the typical steps for setting up a personal blog. The Add-on could be modular so that new tours could be added by the community and chosen by the user.

## GitHub Levitation

In a nutshell, the objective of Levitation is to "make it easy to publish beautiful writing on GitHub." Right now, the process of setting up GitHub Pages is not immediately obvious for new users and, once installed, they're still required to edit HTML. Also, the provided "themes" for GitHub pages are built to highlight software projects. The power of GitHub Pages is obvious, and we would like to unlock that potential for people with big ideas and something to say.

Levitation aims to make using GitHub pages as easy as something like Wordpress or Medium. The aspirational goal is to make a beautiful reading experience for great writing, and to connect those reading experiences together into a "small pieces loosely joined" ecosystem of ideas.
