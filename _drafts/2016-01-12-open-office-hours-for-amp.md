> Instant. Everywhere. That’s the goal of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project: an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once, and have it load instantly everywhere.
> 
> We know you’ve got questions about AMP, and we will do our very best to answer them and help you create a better mobile experience for your users. 
> 
> Over the next 6 weeks, we’ll host weekly Hangouts on Air with speakers discussing AMP and many of its specific components. Richard Gingras, Head of News @ Google, will kick off the series with an overview and vision of AMP: a faster, open mobile web. Google Product Managers will discuss specific components of AMP like Analytics, Ads, and Format Innovation, and they’re here to answer your questions! We’ll continue after 6 weeks with Open Office Hours so you can bring any burning questions you may have about AMP.
