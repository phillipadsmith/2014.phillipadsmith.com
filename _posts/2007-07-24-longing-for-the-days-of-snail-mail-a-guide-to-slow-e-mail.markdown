<p>What would happen if you took the concepts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food">slow food</a> movement and applied them to the chronic cognitive overload lifestyle that many of us lead? Well, you'd get the <strong>slow e-mail movement</strong> of course. What's the slow e-mail movement? Well, if I were to put it in my own words: it's a 2-step program for teaching yourself, and your peers, to take it a bit easier on the <em>send &amp; receive</em> and <em>reply</em> buttons (achieving instant karmic balance points in the process!)</p>

<p>To that <a href="http://www.inpraiseofslow.com/slow/">IBM manager</a> that supposedly appends "Read your mail just twice each day. Recapture your life's time and relearn to dream. Join the slow email movement!" I say: <strong>not enough!</strong></p>

<p>My recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read your e-mail just once a day.</li>
<li>More importantly, <em>respond</em> to your e-mail only once a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been a member of my self-prescribed slow e-mail movement for six months now. I was always a bit slow on the e-mail, but the guideline to respond less, in addition to checking it less, is what made all the difference. Now, I'm usually able to glide through a day without worrying too much about the inbox, and <em>mostly</em> focused on the work that my clients are paying me for.</p>

<p>Why do it? Well, for me, it's all about the promise I've made to my clients to go above-and-beyond -- and this is the program that helps me deliver that commitment. I needed a way to clear my mental space for "real work<small><sup>TM</sup></small>," which is usually activities involving at least 3-hours of distraction-free application of my mental energy and full attention. This is the secret for how I can consistently get into the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">flow</a>"</p>

<p>There are some other great side benefits of the slow e-mail movement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pace</strong>: After a while, the natural rhythm takes over and other people start to think "hey, if Phillip can ignore his e-mail for a whole day, I bet that I can too!"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: If you've ever e-mailed me, you've probably noticed I always get back to you within 48 hours (and probably less than 24 on most occasions); and your e-mail never sits un-answered for a week or more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attention</strong>: While I'm ignoring your e-mails, rest assured that I'm applying that attention to solve your most pressing problems!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sanity</strong>: let's face it, between project notifications, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> commit messages, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> updates and invitations (I've never been so popular!), and the usual deluge of e-mail-based conversations, there is just way too much information to distract me during the day (from doing "real work<sup><small>TM</small></sup>").</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, in summary, what I do is: get my inbox emptied <strong>once</strong> -- in the morning (both reading and responding) -- and then forget about it until the next day. I also apply a "Before today" filter to my inbox, so that I'm only seeing messages from yesterday or before, which helps me to be consistent with always replying a day later.</p>

<p>Do I cheat? Sure I do. At lunch or when I'm searching for e-mail on a project, etc. There are always exceptions. But, what I try not to do is <em>answer</em> those e-mails. As far as your experience of my committment to slow e-mail goes: I'm a saint.</p>

<p>Still need convincing? How about these selling points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It's easy</strong>: all you have to do is be consistent (and what's easier than that?)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's fun</strong>: there's nothing like making your friends, family, or better yet -- clients! -- wait</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's simple</strong>: just sit back and relax and remember that the world turned before you and I were addicted to e-mail</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it folks, it's that easy. You too can join the slow e-mail movement! <strong>Pledge your e-mail chastity in the comments below.</strong></p>
