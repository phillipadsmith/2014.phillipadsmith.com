Whenever I start a new Web project, I ask myself the question "So, where do I start again?" It has been more than fifteen years, but I still don't feel like I have a consistent workflow, a rhythm, for starting a project from scratch.

I usually think "So, what did I do last time? That _must_ be a good place to start." Most recently, I ended up using the [Less Framework](http://lessframework.com/) a couple of times, but noticed that the author, [Joni Korpi](http://twitter.com/jonikorpi), has subsequently developed two other systems, [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/) and [Golden Grid System](http://goldengridsystem.com/).

Sadly, my old friend [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) feels downright long-in-the-tooth these days.

A quick look around reveals that we're literally awash in a sea of CSS frameworks right now. From the newly-minted "responsive & responsible" kinds, like [320andup](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) by [Andy Clarke](http://twitter.com/malarkey), to old faithfuls like the aforementioned Blueprint, [960](http://960.gs/), and tools like [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). It's a beautiful thing and a challenge at the same time.

Why frameworks? I had [a friendly debate with Andy Clarke about them back in 2009](http://www.newint.org/blog/tech/2009/04/08/semantically-speaking/), while we were both working on the [re-development of New Internationalist online](http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/the_new_internationalist_home_page_challenge).

Since having ditched Photoshop, Illustrator, and Omnigraffle for mock-ups and wireframes, [choosing instead to just use HTML](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup) (thanks to Andy for the final push I needed), I feel more attached than ever to the idea of a CSS framework to help me get over the initial hump of experimenting with the position of elements on a page.

And now, with the majority of the Web community shouting from the hills [responsive design!](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) and [mobile first!](http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu), it's hard to just turn a blind eye to these ideas and experiments, especially when starting from ground zero on a new project.

Back to square one. So I'm starting a new Web project, it's been a couple months, and I'd like to make sure that nothing tectonic has changed while I was away, busy and distracted working on non-Web things. Did screen sizes jump, or shrink? Are there whole new ways of thinking about delivering images to varying screen sizes, like Sencha's [Sencha.io](http://www.sencha.com/products/io/) or Filament Group's [Responsive Images](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images)? Are there whole new ways of thinking about Web development in general, like Scott Jehl's mind-bending presentation title "[Responsive & Responsible](http://filamentgroup.com/examples/bdconf-2011/sjehl-bdconf-2011.pdf)"?

Sometimes you step away for a couple of months and important things happen. It's good to catch-up. But, as several friends and colleagues suggested on Twitter -- a conclusion I also came to shortly thereafter -- the basics are still the basics. It's all just HTML(5!), CSS(3!), and JavaScript.

It's fun to [Yak Shave](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving), but -- at the end of the day -- I always have to remind myself: **Just mark-up the damn content!** There's really nowhere else to start, no matter how you slice it.  :)
