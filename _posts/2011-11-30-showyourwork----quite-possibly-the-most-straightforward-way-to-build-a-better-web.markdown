Just a quick, fun anecdote today.

A couple of days ago -- mostly as a "note to self" -- I [wrote up the mod_rewrite recipe](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/11/note-to-self-a-simple-way-to-accomplish-mobile-site-redirection-using-mod-rewrite.html) that I'm using on [The Tyee](http://thetyee.ca) to re-direct people visiting the site from mobile devices.

It's nothing original. There are lots of examples out there in the wild. On the surface, that post is just a raindrop in that information ocean called the Internet.

However, the day after I posted it, I received this note from the CTO of a technology company in South Africa:

> I stumbled across your mod-rewrite script on your blog and wanted to ask if it is okay to use it on our site - I think this is so far the best solution I have come across.

Flattery will get you anywhere! The e-mail continues:

> One question: We have two mobi-sites (m.domain.com which is jQueryMobile and mo.domain.com which is standard HTML/CSS) - in our case I would really like to route certain requests (especially BlackBerry and Symbian) to our mo.domain.com site. How do you suggest this could be achieved?

A sent back a quick response yesterday with the following recipe (with obvious caveats):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1410885.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

And got this response today:

> This is awesome - we just put it on our site and your changes work like a charm! Thanks again for your very helpful article and prompt help.

If only saving the world were so easy. :)

Okay, so what's the point? Well, just to underscore [what's been said before](http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/09/02/show-your-work/), [often quite eloquently](http://sinker.tumblr.com/post/10506542377/open-source-in-the-newsroom-at-ona11), that the first step toward building a better, more open Web -- for [journalism](http://knightmozilla.org), for [education](http://hackasaurus.org), for [cinema](http://webmademovies.org), for [just about everything](http://openeverything.us/) -- is to [#ShowYourWork](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23ShowYourWork).

It's really that simple.
