Working with Mozilla can feel more like being a part of a big family than working with a silicon valley technology giant. Mozilla is home to several old friends and a growing number of new friends. All of this is probably why I can't help but feel all warm and fuzzy when I see stuff like "[The Mozilla Story](https://donate.mozilla.org/page/contribute/the-mozilla-story?source=phillipadsmith)."

But today I'm asking myself: Why does _this_ story need to be told?

When I met with [Scott Rosenberg](http://www.wordyard.com/) last week, he reminded me of another of Mozilla's founding stories. It was the story of when [Mitchell Baker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker) was known as "Chief Lizard Wrangler" and general community manager for the Mozilla Project. [Mitch Kapor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor) turned to her for general advice on building an open source community when he decided to start the [Chandler Project](http://chandlerproject.org/) almost ten years ago. This early collision of two nodes are part of a chain reaction that is responsible for a network that is more than [400 million nodes strong today](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/03/22/mozilla-launches-firefox-4-and-delivers-a-fast-sleek-and-customizable-browsing-experience-to-more-than-400-million-users-worldwide-2/).

These stories are enjoyable artifacts of a time when technology was as idealistic as it was enterprising. But, frankly, **I don't think that either of these back stories is what's interesting or exciting about Mozilla _today_.**

What *is* genuinely exciting is the enormous global community of makers and hackers that are coalescing around the projects, events, and ideas that are coming out of Mozilla **right now**.

The big challenge, however, is helping people find their way through this bottom-up, globally-distributed, network of opportunities to get involved. Another challenge is telling the _unfolding_ Mozilla story. Not the big-picture feel-good story, but the hundreds of micro stories that make the big stuff possible every day.

It's a challenge that I was lucky enough to explore with Mozilla's "Chief Storyteller" [Matt Thompson](http://openmatt.wordpress.com/) several times this year. Each conversation left me more inspired to keep pushing the boundaries of what might be possible for a re-invented Planet Mozilla.

It's a challenge that people like [Lucas Rocha](http://lucasr.org/about/) are thinking about also, as Mozilla roles out its new [Contributor Stewards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Stewards) initiative. It's a challenge that [Ben](http://www.benmoskowitz.com/), [Brett](http://mozillapopcorn.org/), [Dan](http://dansinker.com/), [Michelle](http://thornet.wordpress.com/), and [Jessica](http://jessicaklein.blogspot.com/) are no doubt all thinking about in their respective projects. And it's a challenge that is being voiced with [more](http://blog.mozilla.com/mrz/2011/10/24/step-2-air-mozilla-reboot/), and [more](http://airshipatlanta.com/2011/12/02/tracking-mozilla/) frequency in the Mozilla-verse at large.

Perhaps it's the right time to get a bigger conversation started, in the open, and -- in classic Mozilla style -- with a napkin sketch:

Mozilla is all about "hacking at the core," so here's the invitation: **Let's hack at the core of Mozilla's story and iterate it toward something we can all be a part of and proud of.**
