[Zona Rosa never sleeps and neither did I.](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2012/01/mexico-day-one-mexico-city.html)

I&#39;m up, but Saturday is already half over. Yikes! Gather my belongings and my wits, consult my options for the day -- today is the day for markets in Mexico City. _I&#39;m off_.

The first destination is the [San Angel district](http://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico_City/San_Angel) for the Bazar Sabado in Plaza de San Jacinto. It&#39;s a lovely spot full of rambling cobblestone streets and a large central plaza full of vendors selling mostly art and hand-made crafts. I duck into a little taqueria and over lunch I make a note to come back again and to bring a camera.

Next, I&#39;m off to [Coyoacan](http://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico_City/Coyoac%C3%A1n). There is a rumour about good artisanal markets there too. I ask for directions. Nothing is as close as it looks on a map in Mexico City. The directions involve at least one minibus, if not two; I think about it for a minute, then I take a taxi.

The taxi drops me in front of a huge shopping mall. Not quite what I was looking for... but, hey, why not? I take a spin through the mall. It&#39;s very upscale. I think I saw a Prada store on my way out. I get new directions and head along Calle Mexico toward destinations unknown.

It&#39;s a sunny warm afternoon and the city is still quiet from the Christmas holidays. I pass the [Viveros Coyoacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viveros_de_Coyoac%C3%A1n), another of the enormous and well-appointed parks that I&#39;ve come across. A wrong turn here and there and I stumble on [La Casa Azul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo_Museum), the birthplace of Frida Kahlo. I take a break in the courtyard and absorb some sun before heading off in search of the [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky_Museum%2C_Mexico_City#The_museum) museum (which I&#39;m not destined to find this day).

A short walk away along Avendida Miguel Hildago I find the centre of Coyoacan, near Jardin Plaza Hildago. Old narrow streets open into several blocks of connecting squares and gardens, all of which are filled with activity: vendors, musicians, food stands, an open-air theatre and much more. I spot a congregation of tents and political information -- perhaps part of the Occupy movement here? I&#39;m not sure. At the far end of all this is the Kiosko de Coyoacan, a two-floor building filled with crafts and food shops. I could easily spend a whole day exploring this part of Coyoacan, but it&#39;s dark now and I head back to Zona Rosa.

Old friend from Argentina, Clare, tells me that, similar to Buenos Aires, people eat late in Mexico City. We arrange to grab a bite at 10 PM. I walk from Zona Rosa to [La Condesa](http://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico_City/Condesa_and_Roma) along Avendia Oaxaca passing several hopping &quot;Cervezarias&quot; as I skim along the edge of Parque Espania. The streets here are not on a grid and it&#39;s easy to get turned around; I end up on Tamaulipas, a long stretch of &quot;[fresa](http://www.asihablamos.com/word/palabra/Fresa.php)&quot; (slang for roughly &#39;hipster&#39; and &#39;posh&#39;) bars and restaurants. I wind my way back to Nuevo Leon and to the small oasis that has been built at the corner Mexicali in front of the restaurant [Bacan](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bac%C3%A1n-Restaurante-Condesa/171702686229227?sk=info).

A bottle of [Escorihuela Gascon](http://www.argentinawineguide.com/reviews/Escorihuela_Gascon_Malbec_04.html) brings back memories of Argentina and sends me on my way home.
