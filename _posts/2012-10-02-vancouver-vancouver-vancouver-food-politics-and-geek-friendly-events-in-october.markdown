I woke up in Vancouver yesterday and sent out a note on Facebook asking friends for recommendations on food, politics, and nerdy fun. My friend [Chris Blattman](http://chrisblattman.com/) would call this a "[Bleg](http://chrisblattman.com/?s=bleg&submit=Search)."

I [did something similar for my visit to Montreal this summer](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2012/08/the-perfect-five-days-in-montreal-as-curated-by-my-tribe.html), but I wrote that after the fact. This time, I thought I'd try posting it before I actually do much and see what else people add to the list. I'll keep updating this post as recommendations come in. 

So far the categories are: beer, coffee, food, and events. (Lots of links are currently missing, but they will be there soon!)

### Beer

* Number one recommendation with a bullet is the [Alibi Room](http://www.yelp.com/biz/alibi-room-vancouver). Recommended by Kate Koliha, Phillip Djwa, and Boris Mann.
* Kat suggests "go to [Bitter](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bitter-tasting-room-vancouver) and have my favourite beer, Crannog's Back Hand of God." (And get a doughnut or three from [Lucky's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/luckys-doughnuts-vancouver))
* Kate adds [Irish Heather](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-irish-heather-vancouver) and the [The Whip](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-whip-restaurant-gallery-vancouver).

### Coffee
* [Gene](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gene-vancouver) is where I started my espresso route this trip. Thanks to Kim Elliot for the introduction. 
* Today I checked out [Kafka](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kafkas-coffee-and-tea-vancouver) on the recommendation of Julie Jenkins and I was not let down. Great spot.
* Boris says "Make sure to also stop in at [Revolver Coffee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/revolver-vancouver#query:Revolver%20Coffee) - best coffee north of San Fran." Serious endorsement.
* Trevor of Clevers Media suggests a trip to [49th Parallel](http://www.yelp.com/biz/49th-parallel-coffee-vancouver), which is next on my list. 

### Food

My own list starts out with the Irish Heather for their "[Long Table Series](http://www.longtableseries.blogspot.ca/)" or their "[Pit for your supper](http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2012/09/irish-heathers-pit-for-your-supper/)" night. 

* From there, Brad leads with [Sushiyama](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushiyama-vancouver) "for delicious tuna sashimi the size of a steak," and [Kishimoto](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kishimoto-japanese-kitchen-vancouver) is given two thumbs up by Kim & Reilly.
* [Boris Mann](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/), the "Mann about town," throws down with [Fat Dragon BBQ](http://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-dragon-bbq-vancouver) and [Nine Dishes](http://www.yelp.com/biz/nine-dishes-restaurant-vancouver)
* Trevor throws in [Save On Meats](http://www.yelp.com/biz/save-on-meats-vancouver)
* [Budgie Burrito](http://www.yelp.com/biz/budgies-burritos-vancouver) gets a nod from Brad, as does [Cafe Montmartre](http://www.yelp.com/biz/montmartre-cafe-vancouver)
* Trish says, [The Acorn](http://www.theacornrestaurant.ca/)

### Places & events

First, a few events this week:

* [Judy Rebick](http://transformingpower.ca/) recommended a few events over lunch last week, starting with the premiere screening of [Occupy Love](http://www.viff.org/festival/films/f6282-occupy-love), Velcro Ripper's new film, at the [Vancouver International Film Festival](http://www.viff.org). Screening Thursday, Saturday, and next week.
* There's also an [opening-night after party for Occupy Love](https://www.facebook.com/events/346390565455396/) that comes highly recommended.
* [Spreading the Maple Spring: Lessons from Quebec's Student Strike (and Victory Party)](http://rabble.ca/whatsup/spreading-maple-spring-lessons-quebecs-student-strike-and-victory-party) was suggested by the whole [rabble.ca](http://rabble.ca) crew, Judy, Kim, and Derrick.
* My colleagues here in [The Tyee's](http://thetyee.ca/) newsroom suggested the "[Can We De-Friend Oil?](http://thetyee.ca/News/2012/10/01/Defriend-Oil/)" talk by Andrew Nikiforuk on Wednesday.

For later in the month:

* John Maxwell kicks things off with a trio of recommendations, starting with [MiniTOC Vancouver](https://minitocvancouver.eventbrite.com/) on October 19th and 20th
* Followed by [Open Education 2012](http://openedconference.org/2012/) at UBC, Oct 16-18
* And, finally, [Wandering Art Metropole](http://www.facebook.com/events/227873267342137/?notif_t=plan_user_invited)
* Reilly from [OpenMedia.ca](http://openmedia.ca) suggests the [DemocracyLOUD! A Fundraiser for Media Democracy Days 2012](https://www.facebook.com/events/413649685349837/) event on October 11th
* The ever-geeky Brad reminds me to check out the [Vancouver Hack Space](vancouver.hackspace.ca)
