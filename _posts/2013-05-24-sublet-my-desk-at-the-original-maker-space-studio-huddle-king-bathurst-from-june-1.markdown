Once again, I'm heading back to my second home in [Oaxaca, Mexico](/tag/mexico/), and that means that I'm looking to sublet my desk at [Studio Huddle](http://www.studiohuddle.com/) from June 1st, 2013 - May 31st, 2014. **The cost is $205/month inclusive (tax, wireless Internet, studio fees, etc.). You should [contact me](/#contact) to visit next week (before May 31st) if you're interested.** Read on for more information...

You might ask why I keep an office in Toronto when I'm away for so much of the year, and there's only one answer to that question: I literally *love* the people I share the space with, and [the space itself is the perfect oasis away from the other distractions in life](http://www.studiohuddle.com/space/).

Studio Huddle is roughly two thousand square feet of old-school style studio space on [Niagara Street (just south of King, just west of Bathurst)](http://goo.gl/maps/6pPW5). North-facing light, white walls, and old hardwood floors -- yep, it has got it all. The space is shared by a [dozen craft artists](http://www.studiohuddle.com/artists/) -- mostly glass and metal artists -- a photographer, and a few digital workers. Physically, the studio is split into five separate spaces: two craft studios, a glass studio, an office, and the large shared main space (~1000sqft). I rent a spot in the office that is located in the front of the space (north side, in photo above); it's filled with light all day and is home to roughly four digital workers and the occasional drop-in from the more creative types. Rent also includes some exclusive use of the main space (negotiated with the rest of the folks in advance), which I must admit I've never managed to make use of, but would be great for photo or video shoot or something along those lines. 

As mentioned, my studio mates are a super-creative bunch, and there's just about every tool and piece of equipment that you can imagine here: think of it as a "hack lab" for non-digital types, i.e., vinyl cutter, computerized CNC machine, silk screening equipment, etc. I have to admit, it's been a breath of fresh air to work in an environment where people are **not** focused on digital work.

Okay, enough waxing poetic about how great the space and the people are, down to the details:

* Sublet is available from June 1st, 2013 - May 31st, 2014, but the dates are flexible
* The rent is $205/month and includes everything, taxes, high-speed wireless Internet, two locked storage shelves, studio fees, etc.
* Also included (photo above) is the use of my fancy-schmancy [Herman Miller Mira chair](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/work-chairs/mirra-chairs.html), a [laptop stand](http://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html), and several reference books (Canadian Oxford dictionary, Oxford Canadian compact dictionary, Bartlett's Roget's thesaurus, and The Chicago Manual of Style).

You should be:

* Responsible: you need to be able to remember to close windows, lock doors, and so on if you're the last person here.
* Thoughtful: if you need to be on the phone all day, it's probably not the right space for you.
* Lightly equipped: there's a good amount of space for a laptop and the usual office accouterments, but probably not for a giant three-screen desktop computer set-up.
* Friendly and flexible: most days, you'll probably be one of two or three people using the space and it's pretty quiet, but some days there's more going on and people are more social and chatty. If you need 100% silence all the time, probably not the right fit.
* Creative: I think the space would be great for a freelance writer or journalists, a video editor or multimedia artists, a Web Maker, or something along those lines.

I think that's it. The start and end dates are flexible, but it would be great -- if you're interested -- if you came to see the space before May 31st.
