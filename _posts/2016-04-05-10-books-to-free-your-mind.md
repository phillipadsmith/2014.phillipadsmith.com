title: 10+ books to free your mind
---

This year, I’m taking a one-time experiment in personal reflection and turning it into an annual tradition. Here’s the general idea: in the weeks leading up to my birthday, I give up some distractions and work to deepen my daily contemplations. If all goes well, enlightenment will be mine!

In all seriousness, it was an eye-opening experience the first time, and I’m confident I’ll learn something new this year too.

Given that I tend to end up with a bit more time on my hands during this period, I like to double-down on my reading list. So I asked friends for recommendations on books “to free your mind.” Here’s what they came up with:

* [Just So Stories](http://amzn.to/25Ft81r) by Rudyard Kipling (recommended by Colleen)
* [The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar](http://amzn.to/1qibpgg) by Roald Dahl (also recommended by Colleen)
* [The Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness](http://amzn.to/1Y9Fglx) by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche (recommended by Ana Paula)
* [An Imaginary Life](http://amzn.to/25FteGa) by David Malouf (recommended by Carlyn)
* [Siddhartha](http://amzn.to/25FthSz) by Hermann Hesse (already read it, yet a great recommendation by Lisa)
* [All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation](http://amzn.to/233WVC8) by Rebecca Traitor (not sure what Yvonne was trying to tell me with this recommendation?) 
* [Middlemarch](http://amzn.to/1Y9FsBc) by George Eliot (already read it, yet great recommendation by Alexandra)
* [The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century’s On-line Pioneers](http://amzn.to/1qibYqq) by Tom Standee (recommended by Rolf)
* [On Love: A Novel](http://amzn.to/1Y9FxF3) by Alain de Botton (another from Rolf)
* [Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology](http://amzn.to/1Y9FCZo) by David Abram (recommended by non-other than [Jeff Warren](http://www.jeffwarren.org/)!) 
* [Think on These Things](http://amzn.to/1Y9FDMT) by Jidda Krishnamurti (recommended by Jennifer and Stephane)
* [The Presence Process: A Journey Into Present Moment Awareness](http://amzn.to/1Y9FOI7) by Michael Brown (recommended by Stephane)

Well, that should get me off to a good start.

If there was a Kindle option available, I downloaded the sample and I’ve started working my way through them. I’ll report back after April 25th.

If you’ve got a recommendation to add, drop me a note on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/phillipadsmith) or here in the comments.

See you on the other side.
