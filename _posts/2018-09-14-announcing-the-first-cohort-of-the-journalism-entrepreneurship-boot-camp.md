Let me ask you, have you ever had to send a letter saying "Thank you for applying. Your project isn’t the right fit this time. Please apply again next round" to more than 20 people whom you deeply respect and appreciate? I had to do that on Wednesday evening and — let me tell you — it is not easy.

And yet the simple truth is that I received a lot of strong applications to the [Journalism Entrepreneurship Boot Camp](https://medium.com/@phillipadsmith/announcing-a-new-journalism-entrepreneurship-bootcamp-lets-reboot-the-media-together-3281a1863451), and making a decision about whom to invite to the first cohort was exceptionally difficult. To give you a sense of how difficult, I had to select just 4 applications from 30 — that’s just more than 10%.

To be honest, I was not expecting so many applications. Each one was thoughtful and engaging. I believe that many of the proposed projects have great potential. It’s my ambition to use this first boot camp as a pilot to demonstrate that this program is effective and can grow to support dozens of projects per cohort.

For this first boot camp, however, I was looking for a small cohort of people working on similar projects, where each was at a similar stage of development. I was looking for applicants who had a clear idea of what outcomes they were seeking. I was looking for individuals with a strong reporting background. I was looking for ideas that had a clear business opportunity. And, most importantly, I was looking for people with passion and commitment.

Without further delay, I’m honored and humbled to introduce you to the inaugural Journalism Entrepreneurship Boot Camp cohort:

**Jacqueline Ronson** ([@jacsrons](https://twitter.com/@jacsrons))

Ronson is an accomplished freelance journalist based on Vancouver Island. She recently broke the story that a controversial racetrack in the Cowichan Valley was not getting fair coverage in the local newspaper, apparently because community news giant Black Press feared upsetting a key advertiser. She got her start in community reporting at the Yukon News in Whitehorse, where her writing earned many regional and national journalism awards.
